# Hubitat-Switch-Bindings
An app for Hubitat that binds switches together.  When bound, if either one turns on or off, the binding will make the other one also turn on/off. (It works a lot like a z-wave association, but it happens in the Hubitat hub, so that the hub can know/display the updated device states.)
